# Bitly Data Exporter

Bitly doesn't let you export click metrics to a csv with a free account, so here's a python solution for that.

Further, with the Bitly free account, you only see 30 days of metrics on the web UI. With the API however, you can view much more data.

I wrote this script just to fill some gaps in my workflows and make my life easier - there are a lot of hardcoded values and assumptions in here. There are several improvements I would make but this is not a project I am currently willing to invest more time in, so please feel free to create PRs to expand this script to match your needs.
